function Render_SceneObjectsToRad(objectMaterialParams,numObjects,lightMaterialParams,numLights,currentConditionNumber)
%converts objects in scene_objects directory into radiance files and
%and sorts into objects and lights folders:
%*objects that are not lights are converted to rad files using the binary application
%obj2rad and then placed into objects_[condition#] directory
%*lights are already .rad files and are copied into lights_[condition#]
%directory
%
%parameters: objectProperties,numObjects/lightProperties,numLights are passed into RenderRoom
%currentConditionNumber is the number of the current condition.
%
%note that this function expects matlab to be in the experiment directory,
%not the scene_objects directory.

%**(bei's RenObjToRad simply copied .obj files instead of applying obj2rad
%if they included 'plane' in  their name. i didn't understand this, and
%left this function out for now. the two scenes that I am working with,
%spherePatch and singleSphere don't have planes, so this may become re
